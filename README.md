# Mips-Project-Calendar-
MIPS Calendar Application
Overview
This MIPS assembly language project implements a simple calendar application that reads events from a file, allows users to perform various operations such as adding, deleting, updating, and selecting events, and then outputs the modified calendar to a file.

Features
Read Events from File: The program reads events from a specified input file, with each event represented by a date and description.

Add Event: Users can add new events to the calendar by providing a date and description.

Delete Event: Users can delete events from the calendar by specifying the date of the event they wish to remove.

Update Event: Users can update existing events in the calendar by specifying the date of the event they wish to modify and providing a new description.

Select Event: Users can select and view details of a specific event by entering its date.

Output Calendar to File: After performing operations on the calendar, the program outputs the modified calendar to a specified output file.

Usage
Compile: Use a MIPS assembler such as MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator) to compile the source code.

Run: Execute the compiled program in the MIPS simulator environment.

Input File: Provide the path to the input file containing the initial calendar events when prompted.

Menu: Follow the on-screen menu prompts to perform desired operations such as adding, deleting, updating, or selecting events.

Output File: Specify the path to the output file where the modified calendar will be saved.
